  - `routes/prizepicks.py` - PrizePicks specific endpoints ✅
  - `routes/analytics.py` - Analytics and predictions ✅
- **Extracted:** All API endpoints from main.py (lines 664-1885)
- **Result:** Organized, focused route handlers with clear responsibilities

### 🔄 In Progress

#### 5. Main.py Cleanup (15% Complete)
- **Tasks:**
  - Update main.py to import from new modules
  - Remove extracted code from main.py
  - Ensure main.py is <500 lines
  - Update FastAPI app to use new routers

### 📋 Remaining Work

#### 6. Circular Dependency Resolution (0% Complete)
- **Tasks:**
  - Create `services/interfaces.py` for abstract base classes
  - Implement dependency injection pattern
  - Use lazy imports where necessary
  - Create service registry pattern

#### 7. Large Service Class Breakdown (0% Complete)
- **Target Classes:**
  - ModelService (920+ lines)
  - UltraEnsembleEngine (1366+ lines)
  - UltraRiskManagementEngine (1456+ lines)
  - DataSourceManager (754+ lines)

### 📊 Impact Metrics

#### Before Refactoring
- **main.py:** 1915 lines (god class)
- **Circular Dependencies:** Multiple try/except import blocks
- **Testability:** Difficult to test individual components
- **Maintainability:** Poor separation of concerns

#### After Current Progress
- **Models:** ✅ Cleanly separated (150+ lines)
- **Middleware:** ✅ Reusable components (120+ lines)
- **Services:** ✅ Isolated business logic (200+ lines)
- **Health Routes:** ✅ Dedicated module (150+ lines)
- **Betting Routes:** ✅ Focused endpoints (120+ lines)
- **Performance Routes:** ✅ User data endpoints (100+ lines)
- **Auth Routes:** ✅ Authentication endpoints (100+ lines)
- **PrizePicks Routes:** ✅ Prop betting endpoints (80+ lines)
- **Analytics Routes:** ✅ ML/Analytics endpoints (150+ lines)
- **Tests:** ✅ All 53 tests still passing
- **Imports:** ✅ All new modules importing correctly

### 🎯 Success Criteria Progress

- [x] Models extracted and organized
- [x] Middleware extracted and reusable
- [x] Business logic isolated
- [x] API routes extracted and organized
- [x] All tests passing (53/53)
- [x] Clear separation of concerns
- [x] Easy to test individual components
- [ ] main.py reduced to <500 lines
- [ ] No circular import errors
- [ ] Improved maintainability

### 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Complete Main.py Cleanup** (Priority: HIGH)
   - Import from new modules
   - Remove extracted code
   - Verify <500 line target

2. **Resolve Circular Dependencies** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - Create service interfaces
   - Implement dependency injection

3. **Break Down Large Service Classes** (Priority: LOW)
   - Split ModelService
   - Break down ensemble engines

### 📝 Notes

- **No Breaking Changes:** All existing functionality preserved
- **Test Coverage:** 100% test pass rate maintained
- **Import Structure:** Clean, logical organization
- **Documentation:** Each module has clear docstrings
- **Type Hints:** Full type annotation maintained
- **Route Organization:** Endpoints grouped by functionality
- **Error Handling:** Consistent error handling across all routes

### 🎉 Major Achievement

**API Routes Extraction Complete!** We have successfully extracted all API endpoints from the 1915-line main.py "god class" into focused, organized route modules. This represents a **massive improvement** in code organization and maintainability:

- **6 dedicated route modules** with clear responsibilities
- **All endpoints preserved** with identical functionality
- **Clean separation** of concerns
- **Easy to test** individual route modules
- **Consistent patterns** across all routes

This refactoring represents a significant improvement in code organization and maintainability while preserving all existing functionality.
