# A1Betting Ultra-Enhanced App Roadmap (2025 Edition)

# A1Betting Ultra-Enhanced App Roadmap (2025 Edition)

## Overview

This roadmap guides the autonomous and human development of the A1Betting platform, integrating backend modules and frontend features for a robust, real-time sports betting experience. Each phase is fully fleshed out with objectives, deliverables, edge cases, and explicit notes for when sequential thinking should be used.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Inventory

**Objectives:**

- Validate backend and frontend structure, including all submodules and dependencies.
- Build a comprehensive inventory of all modules, services, and components.
- Ensure the environment is stable, reproducible, and documented for onboarding.

**Deliverables:**

- `Inventory.md` with:
  - Full module/component list
  - Dependency graph
  - Version matrix for dependencies
  - Platform-specific setup notes
- Verified backend and frontend startup, health endpoints operational.
- All known issues and lint errors resolved.
- Automated environment setup script (e.g., `setup.sh`/`setup.bat`).

**Checkpoints:**

- Inventory.md reviewed and validated by both agent and human.
- Environment setup script tested on all target OSes.
- Health endpoints and startup logs archived for reproducibility.

**Edge Cases:**

- Hidden dependencies, circular imports, or platform-specific issues.
- Inconsistent environment setup across OSes.
- Legacy code or undocumented modules.

**Sequential Thinking Triggers & Examples:**

- When a dependency error is ambiguous, recursively trace imports and document findings.
- If a module’s purpose or relationship is unclear, break down its usage and dependencies step by step.
- When onboarding a new developer or agent, use sequential thinking to validate environment setup and inventory completeness.

## Phase 2: Backend Feature Integration

**Objectives:**

- Integrate all backend modules/services into PrizePicks/PropOllama endpoints.
- Ensure real-time data scraping, robust error handling, and health checks.
- Modularize backend for future extensibility and third-party integrations.

**Deliverables:**

- Responsive endpoints returning:
  - Mock data for development
  - Live data for production
- Ensemble ML, risk management, caching, and monitoring connections validated.
- Autonomous system endpoints and background initialization validated.
- Legacy endpoints hardened for backward compatibility.
- API contract documentation for each endpoint.

**Checkpoints:**

- All endpoints tested with both mock and live data.
- Error handling validated with simulated failures.
- API contract reviewed and versioned.

**Edge Cases:**

- Data source outages, schema changes, or unexpected API responses.
- ML model failures or slow initialization.
- Backward compatibility with legacy clients.

**Sequential Thinking Triggers & Examples:**

- When integrating a new data source, break down the process: schema validation → error handling → live test.
- For ML ensemble failures, sequentially isolate model, data, and runtime issues.
- When refactoring legacy endpoints, use stepwise validation to ensure no regressions.

---

## Phase 3: Frontend Modernization

**Objectives:**

- Implement a streamlined, user-friendly frontend with three main pages:
  1. **Locked Bets/PropOllama Main Page:**
     - Display the most accurately predicted, real-time, locked sports bets for users to profit from.
     - Pull bets from multiple real-time available sportsbooks, labeling each bet with its source site for transparency.
     - PrizePicks should be the default and priority source, but other sportsbooks can be included and clearly labeled.
     - Use advanced code and LLMs to compute and surface the best possible predictions.
     - Internally analyze all available data and modules to serve only the most actionable information.
  2. **Live-Stream Page:**
     - Embed an internal browser display set to 'the.streameast.app' for users to watch games in real time.
     - Integrate live game context with betting recommendations.
  3. **Conjoined Settings/Admin Page:**
     - Show basic settings for regular users (profile, theme store, background service monitoring, etc.).
     - Show advanced admin features only for administrators (scrape and merge best features from existing settings/admin pages).
     - Leverage all existing code and modules for maximum capability and best-in-class experience.

**Deliverables:**

- Unified React/Vite/TypeScript frontend with:
  - Locked Bets/PropOllama main interface (single page, clean output)
    - Supports pulling bets from multiple sportsbooks, with clear source labeling and PrizePicks as the default/priority.
  - Live-stream page with embedded browser (the.streameast.app)
  - Conjoined settings/admin page (conditional rendering for admin features)
- Unified analytics, dashboards, modals, tables, charts, loaders, error boundaries, and connection status indicators.
- Polished theme, styles, and assets.
- Accessibility audit and performance benchmarks.

**Checkpoints:**

- All pages functional, visually appealing, and easy to use on all target devices.
- Accessibility and performance validated.
- Frontend-backend integration tested with live and mock data.
- All existing code and modules leveraged for best possible user experience.

**Edge Cases:**

- Responsive design issues, browser compatibility, or accessibility gaps.
- API changes breaking frontend integration.
- Performance bottlenecks with large datasets.
- Conditional rendering and feature access for admin vs. regular users.

**Sequential Thinking Triggers & Examples:**

- For multi-step user flows (e.g., placing a bet or switching between main/stream/settings pages), break down each UI interaction and backend call.
- When merging features from existing settings/admin pages, sequentially analyze and select the best components and logic.
- For accessibility or performance audits, sequentially validate each requirement and benchmark.
