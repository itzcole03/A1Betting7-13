## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **API Integration Strategy**

```typescript
// Primary: Comprehensive backend API
await fetch('/api/prizepicks/comprehensive-projections');

// Fallback: Direct PrizePicks API for each sport
ALL_PRIZEPICKS_SPORTS.map(sport =>
  fetch(`https://api.prizepicks.com/projections?league_id=${sport}&single_stat=true`)
);

// Last Resort: Enhanced mock data with all sports
generateComprehensiveMockProjections();
```

### **Dynamic Filter Population**

```typescript
const filterOptions = useMemo(() => {
  const sports = new Set(projections.map(p => p.sport));
  const leagues = new Set(projections.map(p => p.league));
  const teams = new Set(projections.map(p => p.team));
  const statTypes = new Set(projections.map(p => p.stat_type));

  return {
    sports: Array.from(sports).sort(),
    leagues: Array.from(leagues).sort(),
    teams: Array.from(teams).sort(),
    statTypes: Array.from(statTypes).sort(),
  };
}, [projections]);
```

### **Enhanced Data Transformation**

```typescript
const transformRawProjection = (rawProjection: any, included: any[]): PrizePicksProjection => {
  // Extracts player, league, and stat information from PrizePicks API response
  // Applies ML predictions and confidence scoring
  // Calculates value rating and Kelly percentages
  // Returns unified PrizePicksProjection format
};
