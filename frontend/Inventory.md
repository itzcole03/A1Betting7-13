# Inventory & Environment Update

## Node & Jest Environment

- Node.js updated to v20.19.3 (latest supported)
- Jest updated to v30.0.4 (latest supported)
- Babel config updated for ESM compatibility
- Polyfill for TextEncoder/TextDecoder added for Node v20+
- Jest setup files split between setupFiles and setupFilesAfterEnv
- Vitest test files and .d.ts test files ignored in Jest config
- Expanded moduleNameMapper to resolve all @/ imports (services, models, unified, etc.)

## Test Suite Status

- Most configuration errors resolved
- Many test failures now due to missing/empty modules or test logic errors
- Some tests pass, confirming environment and config are correct
- Remaining failures require code and test logic fixes (not config)

## Recommended Practices

- Ensure all test files contain valid test definitions
- Remove or ignore .d.ts and Vitest test files from Jest runs
- Implement missing modules referenced in tests (e.g., RefereeService, AffiliateService, UnifiedBettingAnalytics)
- Fix runtime errors in test logic (undefined variables, constructor errors, etc.)
- Keep Node, Jest, and Babel up-to-date for best compatibility
- Use moduleNameMapper for all major folders to support @/ imports
- Use setupFiles for polyfills and setupFilesAfterEnv for test environment extensions

## Next Steps

- Refactor and implement missing modules
- Fix failing test logic
- Continue recursive autonomous development as per roadmap

---

Environment and configuration are now robust and up-to-date. Remaining issues are code/test logic related, not config.
